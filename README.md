# E-flyer_ITL
Create an E-flyer for Integra Technologies Limited.

A flyer (or flier) is a form of paper advertisement intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. 
Flyers are used to market businesses, events and products. ... With the Internet, e-flyers can be created and emailed to recipients or placed on websites, where they can be opened and printed (if so desired).

###Using current technology to provide electronic information displays rather than posting paper flyers, this project will run for a year as a preview of a more permanent way of getting information to the campus community, in particular events and activities of interest to students.
